# A.I.D.A - Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics System

A.I.D.A is a project that incorporates Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Analytics to create a chatbot capable of engaging in natural language conversations. The chatbot is designed to provide responses based on the input it receives from users, leveraging the power of OpenAI's GPT-3 model.

## Prerequisites

Before running the chatbot, make sure you have the following:

1. An OpenAI API key: To access GPT-3 and utilize its language generation capabilities, you need to obtain an API key from OpenAI. Please refer to the OpenAI documentation on how to get an API key.

> **Note:** OpenAI's GPT-3 model is a paid service, and you may need to create a new account and subscribe to a plan to access the API.

2. Python environment: The chatbot is written in Python, so ensure that you have a Python environment set up on your machine. You can install Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/) and set up a virtual environment if desired.

## Installation

To set up the A.I.D.A chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: Use the following command to clone the A.I.D.A repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/A.I.D.A.git
   ```
   Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. Install dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Provide your OpenAI API key: Open the `openaiapikey.txt` file and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key. Save the file.

## Usage

To run the chatbot, execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
python chatbot.py
```

The chatbot will start running, and you can engage in a conversation with it. Simply type your message and press Enter to send it to the chatbot. The chatbot will respond with a generated message based on the conversation history.

## Chat Log Storage

The chatbot saves the conversation history in JSON format. The logs are stored in the `chat_logs` directory, with each log file containing the details of the conversation between the user and the chatbot. The logs include the speaker, timestamp, message content, UUID (unique identifier), and vector representation of the message.

## Additional Notes

- The chatbot utilizes the GPT-3 model for language generation. The `gpt3_completion` function communicates with the OpenAI API to generate responses based on the given prompt.

- The chatbot incorporates a memory system to fetch and summarize relevant memories from previous conversations. It considers both episodic memories (recent chat history) and declarative memories (facts, information, etc.) to generate contextually appropriate responses.

- The `gpt3_embedding` function converts the input content into an embedding vector using the specified GPT-3 engine. This vector representation helps in calculating semantic similarity and finding relevant memories.

- The `fetch_memories` function retrieves relevant memories based on the vector representation of the current input. It sorts and selects the most similar memories to incorporate them into the response generation process.

- The `summarize_memories` function summarizes a block of memories into one payload and sends it as a prompt to GPT-3. The generated notes are saved along with their corresponding UUIDs, timestamps, and embedding vectors for future reference.

- The `get_last_messages` function retrieves the most recent chat messages from the conversation history to provide context for generating a response.

## Purpose of the Chatbot

The purpose of the A.I.D.A chatbot is to provide an intelligent and interactive system that can understand and respond to natural language input. It aims to simulate human-like conversation and provide helpful information, suggestions, or guidance based on the user's queries or statements.

The chatbot utilizes the power of artificial intelligence and data analytics to analyze and process the input from users. It leverages the GPT-3 model from OpenAI to generate responses that are coherent, context-aware, and relevant to the user's input.

The chatbot's primary function is to assist users in finding information, answering questions, providing recommendations, and engaging in meaningful conversations. It can be used in various domains, such as customer support, virtual assistants, educational platforms, and more.

## How to Make Your Own Chatbot

To create your own chatbot similar to A.I.D.A, you can follow these general steps:

1. Define the Scope: Determine the purpose, functionality, and target audience for your chatbot. Identify the specific tasks or domains it will handle.

2. Choose a Platform: Select a programming language or framework to build your chatbot. Python is a popular choice due to its extensive libraries and ease of use.

3. Data Collection: Gather a dataset of conversations or relevant data to train your chatbot. This data will help the chatbot understand and respond appropriately to user input.

4. Preprocess and Clean the Data: Clean and preprocess the conversation data by removing irrelevant information, formatting it properly, and ensuring consistency.

5. Train the Model: Use machine learning or deep learning techniques to train your chatbot model. You can explore pre-trained models like GPT-3 or build your own using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

6. Implement the Chatbot Logic: Develop the logic for processing user input, generating responses, and managing the conversation flow. Consider using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand user intent and context.

7. Integrate External APIs: If needed, integrate external APIs or services to enhance the chatbot's functionality. For example, you can integrate a weather API to provide weather information or a knowledge base API to fetch relevant facts.

8. Test and Refine: Test your chatbot extensively to identify and fix any bugs or issues. Collect feedback from users and iterate on the design and functionality to improve the user experience.

9. Deploy the Chatbot: Deploy your chatbot on a server or cloud platform to make it accessible to users. Ensure it can handle concurrent users and provide a seamless experience.

10. Monitor and Update: Continuously monitor the chatbot's performance, user feedback, and usage patterns. Update the chatbot regularly to add new features, improve responses, and address user needs.

Remember, creating a chatbot is an iterative process, and it may require multiple iterations to refine and enhance its capabilities. The A.I.D.A project can serve as a starting point, and you can customize and extend it based on your specific requirements and use cases.
